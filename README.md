# The project built using Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Filters Component

The project was made to show and apply the Filters Component, which handle/manage the filters that the user can choose in both big and small screen sizes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runners, where I used Jest and enzyme utility to manage components test.

# Note
I'm beginner in the unit testing field, I learned and practiced the basics and still moving forward to gain more knowledge and experience as can as possible :).
